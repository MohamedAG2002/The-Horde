# The Horde
A game where you must defend your stronghold against hordes of incoming zombies.
You--the player--are equipped with the most advanced modern weapons since the apocalypse--a shotgun and a pistol. Use your arsenal to kill those zombies and prevent them from breaking the barricade at any cost.

# Controls 
The whole game is controlled with the keyboard, including the UIâ€”anything you do in the game you do with the keyboard.

To move the player use WASD or the ARROW KEYS.
To shoot press SPACE.
To switch your weapons use Q and E. The Q key equips the pistol while the E key equips the shotgun.

Prefer the help screen in the game if you're stuck.

# How to use
If you want to play around with the code or take a closer look at it, you need to install MonoGame(go to the MonoGame website for further instructions), and then just clone the project. 

On the other hand, if you want to just play the game, you can go to the game's itch.io page.
